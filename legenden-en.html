<p>Secrets, myths and legends
Abandoned places fascinate people not only because of their morbid beauty, but also because of the stories that surround them. Many of these places are the scenes of legends that have endured for decades and still give people goosebumps today. Urbex Scope gets to the bottom of these myths and lets you immerse yourself in the dark world of lost stories.</p><p>Example 1:
There are places where visitors claim to have heard whispering voices - voices that supposedly lure them into abandoned rooms. In an old sanatorium deep in the forest, a doctor is said to have taken his own life after being struck down by a mysterious illness. Since then, Urbexers have repeatedly reported flickering lights, strange shadows and the feeling of not being alone.</p><p>Example 2:
Another legend tells of an abandoned children's home where children were trapped and died during an epidemic. Some believe their souls are still trapped there. Nightly crying, children's laughter or small footprints in the dust cause sleepless nights for visitors.</p><p>Example 3:
Even old factories harbor their secrets: In a machine hall of a disused textile factory, a worker is said to have once died when a machine exploded. Since then, courageous visitors have reported a recurring bang, metallic screeching and cold draughts of air passing through the ruins.</p><p>Example 4:
Another well-known legend revolves around a villa on the outskirts of the city. The owner is said to have poisoned her guests in order to get her hands on their fortune. Allegedly, her victims still haunt the rooms to this day - a figure in black is said to regularly appear at the windows, while a soft whisper says “Go now!”.</p><p>Example 5:
But not all myths are just gloomy: some tell of lost treasures that are said to lie dormant in the cellars of old castles or under the floorboards of buried inns. Urbexers tell of maps that supposedly lead to these treasures and of secret signs on the walls that only reveal the way to the initiated.</p><p>Whether true story or flourishing fantasy - the world of lost places thrives on these legends. Each place tells its own story, some louder, others quieter. Urbex Scope will gradually uncover these myths and get to the bottom of them. Look forward to our research, interviews with contemporary witnesses and the stories that hide like fog between the walls.</p><p>Soon you will find a growing collection of these tales here: from ghost hauntings to treasure hunts, from ancient family curses to modern legends whispered by urban explorers on their nightly forays.</p></body>
