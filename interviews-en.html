<p>People in Urbex
Find out more about the people behind the camera: Urbexers, photographers, contemporary witnesses and adventurers talk about their passion and their experiences.</p><p>Interview with Lisa (photographer)
Question: Lisa, how did you actually get into urban exploring?
Lisa: To be honest? It started with my passion for lost-place photography. I've always been fascinated by abandoned buildings and their history. My first adventure was an old textile factory in my hometown - the smell of oil and dust immediately captivated me.</p><p>Question: What appeals to you most about these places?
Lisa: For me, lost places are like time capsules. Every room tells a story - be it about the people who worked there or about events that have left their mark. I also love the play of light between decay and nature.</p><p>Question: Was there a moment that particularly stuck in your memory?
Lisa: Absolutely. I was once standing in an abandoned church that had been reclaimed by nature. Rays of sunlight fell through the broken roof, everything was silent - except for a few birds flying through the windows. It was pure magic.</p><p>Interview with “Ghost” (Urbex veteran)
Question: Ghost, you've been active in the scene for over 10 years. How has Urbex changed for you?
Ghost: Urbex used to be a small community. People exchanged information discreetly, gave each other tips - it was all very informal. Today that has changed: On the one hand, social media has made it easier to reach others, but it has also attracted many “location hunters” who are often out and about with no respect for the places.</p><p>Question: How do you deal with the issue of safety?
Ghost: Security is the be-all and end-all. I check every building for the risk of collapse before entering and always take a headlamp and gloves with me. I also never go out alone - you never know what to expect.</p><p>Question: Do you have a favorite place?
Ghost: There are many. But if I had to name one: an abandoned mental hospital with huge corridors and an old operating theater. The atmosphere was indescribable - you could literally feel the stories there.</p><p>Interview with Tom (beginner)
Question: Tom, you are relatively new to Urbexing. How was your first time?
Tom: I was totally nervous! I had read a lot and watched a lot of videos, but when I stood in front of this old hospital, my heart was beating like crazy. Nevertheless, it was an incredible feeling to walk through the deserted corridors.</p><p>Question: What did you learn from your first tours?
Tom: That preparation is everything. Without good shoes and a headlamp, I would probably have got lost or injured myself. I also learned to always pay attention to my surroundings.</p></body>
