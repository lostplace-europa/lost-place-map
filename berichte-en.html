<p>Urbex adventures up close
In this section, we take you into the fascinating world of urban exploring. Here you will find exciting reports from urban explorers who passionately document their tours through abandoned places. These reports are more than just stories - they are snapshots of history, atmosphere and a sense of adventure. Be inspired and discover the world of lost places first-hand.</p><p>1. abandoned places full of history
Every lost place has its own story - be it an old villa, an abandoned train station or a dilapidated factory building. Our reports tell you about the traces of times gone by: withered wallpaper, yellowing documents and relics from another era. Our authors take you on a journey through the past and let you feel the atmosphere of these places up close.</p><p>2. thrills and challenges
Urbex is often a balancing act between fascination and risk. Deteriorating floors, unstable ceilings and unexpected encounters make every tour unique - and sometimes dangerous. Our reports show you how our authors deal with such challenges: with prudence, team spirit and the necessary respect for danger. Learn from their experiences and find out how you can better prepare yourself.</p><p>3. personal impressions and highlights
Urbex is also a journey into yourself. Many explorers report a special feeling when they enter a Lost Place: the smell of dust, the play of light and shadow, the silence that is suddenly broken by a breeze. These little moments make exploring a lost place an unforgettable experience. Our authors share their highlights with you - from breathtaking photo motifs to moving moments of silence.</p><p>4. first-hand tips and tricks
Each report contains valuable tips: How do you find the best lost places? How do you navigate safely through unknown buildings? What equipment will help you avoid dangers? Our authors give you practical advice - from choosing the right shoes to dealing with local regulations. So you can make your own adventures safer and more exciting.</p><p>5. community highlights and interviews
In addition to classic reports, you will also find interviews with experienced Urbexers.
